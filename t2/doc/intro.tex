% state the learning objective 
The objective of this laboratory assignment is to study a circuit containing a
sinusoidal voltage source $v_s$ connected to seven resistors ($R_1$ to $R_7$), a capacitor $C$, a dependent voltage source (current-controlled) and a dependent current source (voltage-controlled).
The circuit can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:t2}.

The nodes are designated with numbers as seen in the Figure~\ref{fig:t2} and the node voltages will be represented with their respective numbers (ex. $V_3$ represents the voltage in node number 3). The characteristic equations of the dependent sources can also be seen in the Figure~\ref{fig:t2}. 

The sinusoidal voltage source follws the equation:

\begin {equation}
	v_s( t )  = V_s u( -t ) + sin( 2 \pi f t ) u( t ) 
	\label{eq:vs}
\end{equation}
where 
\begin {equation}
	u( t ) =  
	\begin{cases*} 
	  0 & if $t < 0$ \\
	1, & if $t \geq 0$
	\end{cases*}
	\label{eq:ut}
\end{equation}


In Section~\ref{sec:analysis}, a theoretical analysis of the circuit is
presented. In Section~\ref{sec:simulation}, the circuit is analysed by
simulation, and the results are compared to the theoretical results obtained in
Section~\ref{sec:analysis}. The conclusions of this study are outlined in
Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.
