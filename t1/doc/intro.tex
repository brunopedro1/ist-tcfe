\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

In this laboratory assignment a circuit will be analysed theoretically and simulated using the circuit simulator tool NGSPICE. Its main objective is to compare the values of an operating point analysis (voltage and current) from a theoretical analysis using the nodal and mesh methods with the results obtained in NGSPICE circuit simulation.
The circuit (Figure~\ref{fig:t1}) is composed of one independent voltage source, one independent current source, one dependent voltage source, one dependent current source, and seven resistors.

In Section~\ref{sec:analysis} of this report, the mesh and nodal methods from theoretical analysis of the circuit are
presented. In Section~\ref{sec:simulation}, the circuit is analysed by
simulation, and the results are commented and compared to the theoretical results obtained in
Section~\ref{sec:analysis}. The conclusions of this study are outlined in
Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.
