% state the learning objective 
The objective of this laboratory assignment is to study a circuit containing a
sinusoidal voltage source $v_s$ connected to seven resistors ($R_1$ to $R_7$), a capacitor $C$, a dependent voltage source (current-controlled) and a dependent current source (voltage-controlled).
The circuit can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:t2}.

The nodes are designated with numbers as seen in the Figure~\ref{fig:t2} and the node voltages will be represented with their respective numbers (ex. $V_3$ represents the voltage in node number 3). The characteristic equations of the dependent sources can also be seen in the Figure~\ref{fig:t2}. 




In Section~\ref{sec:analysis}, a theoretical analysis of the circuit is
presented. In Section~\ref{sec:simulation}, the circuit is analysed by
simulation, and the results are compared to the theoretical results obtained in
Section~\ref{sec:analysis}. The conclusions of this study are outlined in
Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.
